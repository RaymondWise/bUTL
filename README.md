#bUTL (Excel add-in)
bUTL is an add-in for Excel that is an accumulation of all the utility and helper code that I have written over the years.  It is heavily geared toward speeding up common utility tasks and is also heavily featured when it comes to working with `Charts`.

I will be adding descriptions of the code and documentation shortly.

For now, the repo contains the compiled file and the VBA source files.  There is some additional configuration for the Ribbon which needs to be added as text.
